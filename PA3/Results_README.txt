Dr. Finn - Due 4/27

Using our MatLab program we generated 50 distinct input files, each representing the n-coloring problem where 1<=n<=50 on the given input matrix. We used the input matrix that was assigned to Zach Peugh. After running MiniSat on these input files, we were able to narrow the range to which the minimum n-coloring belonged to [12, 15].
